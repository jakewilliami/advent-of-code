<sup>Note: I did not participate in Advent of Code from 2015&ndash;2019.  I discovered Advent of Code in 2020 after learning about programming in late 2019.  I have participated in AoC ever since.  I usually fall off some time after day 20 (they call it a &ldquo;skill issue&rdquo;).</sup>

<sup>[My personal AOC Julia module](https://github.com/jakewilliami/advent-of-code/tree/519d7473d57b6b5de57e7b5abce5b5283aff2f0e/common/AdventOfCode.jl) has since been migrated to its own repository at [jakewilliami/AdventOfCode.jl](https://github.com/jakewilliami/AdventOfCode.jl) for conveinent package management and tagging.</sup>
