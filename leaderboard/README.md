# Leaderboard Interfaces

It is convenient to have interfaces to the leaderboard (both my private leaderboard for work, and my personal leaderboard).  This directory contains various projects for these.

Keep your environment variable file (`.env`) in this directory, as subdirectories symlink to it:
```dotenv
LEADERBOARD_ID=...
SESSION_COOKIE=...
```
